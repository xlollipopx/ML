# ML arrival delay prediction
This project uses two regression machine learning algorithm to predict plane arrival delay.
Algorithms are linear regression and random forest tree regression
## Data Analysis
For the study was used dataset in here https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7
In order to properly process the data, there are some variables from the
dataset that canâ€™t be included since their values are only
known only when the plane has already taken off and all the algorithms
would than return inaccurate results. So, all such columns 
were dropped. 

To use regression algorithm
